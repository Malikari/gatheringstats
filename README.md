# MTG PT Results

A static site showing results for every MTG Pro Tour (as much as I've been able to find). The display code is fairly simple--most of the work was in data gathering. 

## Data Format

The site loads all data statically from three data files: players.json, recent.json, and tournaments.json. These are used for the three types of views: player, recent (the initial page showing tournament summaries), and tournament. If you want to add more tournaments or correct any data, these are where it goes.
